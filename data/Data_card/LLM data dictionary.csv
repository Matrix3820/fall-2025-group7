profile,"Peer profile: TDprof_norm, ASDprof_norm, or ASDprof_unif. These represent the preference profiles of the 3 kids participants learned about. Participants will have data for at least 2 profiles."
subject,Participant ID followed by a random code for the current profile
td_or_asd,"Is this participant classified as TD (typically developing) or ASD? 0 = TD, 1 = ASD"

free_response,Participant's free response -- what they think about the peer they just learned about.

LPA_Profile_ASD_only,"Which cluster (1-4) was the participant assigned to based on the skewness and variance of their self preferences? (from latent profile analysis including all ASD participants only, skewness and variance mean centered)"
